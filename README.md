# SecuraX: Unleashing AI for Smarter Policing with Privacy Baked In ðŸ”’

SecuraX is an AI-powered platform that enables law enforcement agencies to leverage the power of cutting-edge technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Federated Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) while ensuring data privacy and civil liberties.

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Analyze data without exposing sensitive information.
- **Federated Learning**: Collaboratively train AI models while keeping data on-premises.
- **Pseudonymization**: Anonymize and mask personal data in documents with flexible retrieval options.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Intuitive web-based interface for seamless user interaction.
